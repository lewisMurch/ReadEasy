 - Make it so the cursor goes back to normal (exciting selection mode) as soon as text starts to be 'read' out
 - Make it so when cancel button is pressed, it doesn't disapear and instead becomes a 'Start Selection Mode' button again

    - Changing text colour
    - Changing background colour

    - Change shortcuts for things
 - Add a cancel button while it is still reading out
