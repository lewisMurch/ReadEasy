 - Fix selection mode so as soon as the plugin is opened, any selected text is instantly read out.
 - Make it so the cursor goes back to normal (exciting selection mode) as soon as text starts to be 'read' out
 - Make a settings menu that has:
    - Changing text colour
    - Changing background colour
    - Changing text size
 - Add a cancel button while it is still reading out
 - Add TTS mode
